# Kitty Choir!

My project is a game where you click on the cats to make them sing.

To play, click on the cats. Use the slider to adjust the volume. Clicking on the sun will start a drum loop, the volume of this can also be adjusted.

Features: Buttons that change when clicked, volume sliders, drum loop
